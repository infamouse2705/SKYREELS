Chapter 1 

The hallway smelled faintly of floor wax and chalk when she stepped inside the building. Her eyes swept from door to door, searching for the room number. When she finally found it, her breath caught.

There, at the back of the classroom, was Jay R.

Last year’s classmate. Last year’s headache.

He leans forward a little, mop in hand, sweeping over the puddle of milk. Sunlight from the window cut across his back, casting long shadows on the floor. He looked up for a second, his face framed by messy hair, but she didn’t bother returning the glance.

She stared at him for a heartbeat, then rolled her eyes so slowly it felt like a full rotation of annoyance. Without a word, she slipped into the room, her bag brushing against the wall. She chose the very first seat, front row — the safest distance from him — and pulled out her notebook.

The chair squeaked. The room was quiet.

A moment later, the teacher entered. She stood tall behind the desk, her voice warm but firm.

“I’ll be your adviser,” she announced.

The air buzzed with first-day nerves. They went through the schedule, the rules, the expectations — the usual orientation. One by one, students stood and introduced themselves. Names floated around like paper airplanes, landing nowhere in particular.

No lessons yet. Just preparation.

By breaktime, she walked to the canteen, bought a sandwich, and settled near the window. When she peeled open the wrapper, the smell of toasted bread rose — comforting, simple.

Then she froze.

Across the walkway stood her friend from last year — the one she once liked more than she should have. His uniform was hidden beneath a black leather jacket, like he’d stepped out of a different world. The sunlight glinted off the smooth material. He looked effortlessly put together.

Their eyes met.

Only for a moment — but it was enough to send her pulse jumping. She snapped her gaze away, pretended to fix her sandwich, and hurried back to her classroom, cheeks warming.

After dismissal, she headed home on foot. The afternoon was warm and golden, the cicadas buzzing from hidden branches. She had to walk to the bus stop near the highway, because the bus that passed the school never went toward her house.

Outside the school gate, she noticed a tall guy standing near the bus stop sign. Same uniform. Same face. He was in her class. He stood still, looking at the road, waiting for the bus.

She glanced once, just a passing look, but when he turned his head toward her, she quickly looked away, pretending to check her phone.

Her pace quickened.

A few minutes later, a bus roared down the road beside her. Its windows were dusty, catching sunlight. As it passed, she saw him through the glass — the tall guy — sitting near the middle, hand gripping the rail as the bus rattled forward.

The bus rolled away, leaving a trail of engine fumes and dust. She continued toward the main intersection.

Her footsteps sounded steady on the pavement. She passed small stores, cracked sidewalks, a dog sleeping under a tricycle.

And then she saw something else.

Near a milk tea stall stood Jay R again. He was waiting, hands in his pockets. The cashier handed him a cup. He took it, nodded, and walked toward a black car parked at the curb.

He opened the door, got in, and started the engine.

She stared.

“He drives a car to school? What a show-off,” she muttered.

A couple of people nearby glanced at her, puzzled, thinking she was talking to herself. She turned away, kept walking, and let the street swallow her words.

The first day of school faded behind her, like a quiet scene at the end of a long afternoon.
